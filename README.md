# Event-based Low-Power and Low-Latency Regression Method for Hand Kinematics from Surface EMG



## Introduction
This repository contains the code to reproduce our paper M. Zanghieri _et al._, “Event-based Low-Power and Low-Latency Regression Method for Hand Kinematics from Surface EMG” [[1]](#1).



## Usage
1. Run ``spikification.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``spikification.py``) to spikify the NinaPro Database 8. 
2. Run ``experiment_taus.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``experiment_taus.py``) for the regression epxeriments.
3. Run ``read_results.ipynb`` to get the results statistics.



## Authors
This work was realized at the [**Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems (NCS)** group](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/ncs.html) of the [**Institute of Neuroinformatics (INI)**](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html) of University of Zürich and ETH Zürich by:
- [Marcello Zanghieri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WnIqQj4AAAAJ&hl=en) -- University of Bologna - work realized as a visiting Ph.D. student at INI's NCS)
- [Prof. Simone Benatti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8Fbi_kwAAAAJ) (University of Bologna, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia)
